= Deploying new versions of the server =

To deploy a new version on www.hoccer.com you should have a remote ropsitory 
to your hoccer-server/.git/config file.

   [remote "hoccer.com"]
       url = ssh://xadmin@throwdata.artcom.de/var/www/throwdata-server
       fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/server/*
       
Then you can simply do a 

 $ git push hoccer.com
 
 to deploy your local version onto the server.
