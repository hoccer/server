								<p id="question">What kind of data can be shared?</p>
								<p>
								  We try to enable as much data types as possible. The iPhone SDK allowes us
								  to only share contacts, text, bookmarks and images. Android is much more open and 
								  <a href="http://tech.artcom.de/blog/?p=233">we can utilize other applications</a>
								  as data providers. With Android you can throw and catch contacts, text, bookmarks, 
								  images and as of lately <i>music</i>. We will add other types like .pdf and .zip soon.  
								</p><br>
								
								<p id="question">What is the maximum range to hoc something?</p>
								<p>We ensure you can hoc within 100 meter.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">Can I hoc files between Android and iPhone?</p>	
								<p>Hoccer has been developed to work with both platforms.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">What is the difference beween sweep and throw/catch?</p>
								<p>Sweeping content from one screen to an other uses the drag n' drop metaphore to inicate 
								a one-to-one data exchange. A thrird person doing the same movement near by will intercept the 
								transmission. Throwing and catching however is a one-to-many distribution. So there is only one
								thrower allowd but an arbitrary number of catchers.</p><br>
								
								<p id="question">How can I hoc to single person only?</p>
								<p>Use the sweep gesture by dragging your content from one touchscreen to the other. When you 
								throw someting, everyone who is in range and does a catch gesture in time will receive
                        your data.</p> <br>

				    			<p id="question">Why does Hoccer need access to my personal information like contacts and browser history?</p>						
								<p>With Hoccer you can share your contacts or bookmarks. Thats why Hoccer needs access to it. 
								   For more details see our <a href="http://tech.artcom.de/blog/?p=304">blog post</a>.</p> <br>
																	
								<p id="question">I can not find Hoccer in the Android market. Where is it?</p>
								<p>The market only shows applications compatible with your version of Android. That's Google's policy 
								   and we try to support all Android version as soon as they get announced.</p> <br>
								   
								<p id="question">I have some problems with my contacts on Android 2.x. What's wrong?</p>
								<p>The contacts API changed in 2.0 and it took some time to catch up. Since our Hovver v1.5 release
								everything should be fine.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">Why does Hoccer not work correctly on HTC Eris, Hero and Tattoo?</p>
								<p>We fixed some bugs related to these devices. We try hard to support Hoccer properly on all devices.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">How does Hoccer transport the files from phone to phone?</p>
								<p>Well, first of all, it does not use Bluetooth. Hoccer needs an internet connection. 
								   If you throw a file it is tagged with your current location and send to a server. 
								   When someone performs the catch gesture within a few seconds Hoccer contacts
                           the server and asks for pending files at the receivers location. If both locations 
                           are in range the file is sent to the receiver.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">How does Hoccer locate my position?</p>
								<p>First Hoccer checks the wireless access points in range. If both peers are in 
								   range of the same access point you don't need a GPS signal to hoc files. 
								   If no common access point is found Hoccer tries to get a GPS 
                           position. If GPS is not available the 'network location' is used as a fall back. 
                           Please keep in mind that Hoccer requires a decent lock on your location 
                           to function properly. Specially the fall back data might not be good enough. 
                           However, it will work as long as all peers agree on the same (wrong) location.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">How can I hoc between my phone and my computer?</p>
								<p>We implemented a <a href="hoc.html">Hoccer webclient</a>. Point the map to your current location and use the widget on 
								   the right-hand side to hoc files.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">How can I hoc my files without using a motion gesture?</p>
								<p>We suggest using the sweep gesture. Also you can use our <a href="hoc.html">webclinent</a> to hoc files.
