								<p id="question">Q: Why does Hoccer need access to my personal information like contacts or browser history?</p>						
								<p>A: With Hoccer you can share your contacts or bookmarks. Thats why Hoccer need access to it.</p> <br>
									
								<p id="question">Q: What is the max. range to hocc something?</p>
								<p>A: We ensure you can hocc within 100 meter.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">Q: Can I hocc files between Android&copy; and iPhone&copy;?</p>	
								<p>A: Yes, Hoccer has been developed to work with both platforms.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">Q: What happens to the tap gesture?</p>
								<p>A: We removed this gesture from Hoccer. The one-to-one feature behind it will come back with a new gesture soon.</p><br>
								
								<p id="question">Q: How can I hocc to one person only?</p>
								<p>A: Everyone who does a catch in time of your throw (and is in range) can hocc the data.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">Q: Why can I not see Hoccer in the android market?</p>
								<p>A: If you have an Android version which is not supported by Hoccer you can't see the App in market. That's a <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;definition by Google.</p> <br>
								<p id="question">Q: Will Hoccer be able to throw other files like .zip or .pdf?</p>
								<p>A: Yes it will. We are working on and hope we can release this feature soon.</p><br>
								
								<p id="question">Q: Why I don't see my caught contacts on Android 2.x ?</p>
								<p>A: The API for contacts changed in 2.0. We are working for support.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">Q: Why does hoccer not work correctly on HTC Hero&copy; or Tattoo&copy; ?</p>
								<p>A: We fixed some bugs on these devices. We hope Hoccer will work properly on
									them now.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">Q: How does Hoccer transport the files from phone to phone?</p>
								<p>A: At first there is no Bluetooth! Hoccer need an internet connection. If you
									do a throw the phone sends <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the file attached with a location to a
									server. When another does a catch the location will also send to the
									server.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If both are in range the file will be send to the
									receiver.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">Q: How locate Hoccer my position?</p>
								<p>A: At first Hoccer try to match one access point in your range. If both peers
									see the one and equal AP <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; you doesn't need a GPS connection to
									hocc files. Second Android&copy; try to get a location via GPS. Otherwise <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;
									&#160;&#160;it try to locate you by check your 'network location', but keep in mind this must not be
									very accurate.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">Q: How can I hocc between my phone and my computer?</p>
								<p>A: On this <a href="hoc.html">site</a> you can throw and catch files. You just
									have to locate your position on the map.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">Q: How can I hocc my files without using a gestures?</p>
								<p>A: Not on the phone. Only on this <a href="hoc.html">site</a> you can throw and
									catch without to make a gesture.</p> <br>
