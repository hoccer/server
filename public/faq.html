				    			<p id="question">Why does Hoccer need access to my personal information like contacts and browser history?</p>						
								<p>With Hoccer you can share your contacts or bookmarks. Thats why Hoccer needs access to it.</p> <br>
									
								<p id="question">What is the maximum range to hocc something?</p>
								<p>We ensure you can hocc within 100 meter.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">Can I hocc files between Android and iPhone?</p>	
								<p>Hoccer has been developed to work with both platforms.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">What happened to the tap gesture?</p>
								<p>We removed this gesture from Hoccer. One-to-one hoccs will come back with a new gesture soon.</p><br>
								
								<p id="question">How can I hocc to one person only?</p>
								<p>Currently you can't. Everyone who is in range and does a catch gesture in time will receive
                           your data. However, we're going to (re-)implement one-to-one hoccs in a future release.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">I can not find Hoccer in the Android market. Where is it?</p>
								<p>The market only shows applications compatible with your version of Android. That's Google's policy 
								   and we try to support all Android version as soon as they get announced.</p> <br>
								   
								<p id="question">Will Hoccer be able to throw other files like .zip or .pdf?</p>
								<p>Yes, it will. We are working on it and hope we can release this feature soon.</p><br>
								
								<p id="question">I can not see my caught contacts on Android 2.x. What's wrong?</p>
								<p>The contacts API changed in 2.0 and we have not caught up yet. We are working on it.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">Why does Hoccer not work correctly on HTC Eris, Hero and Tattoo?</p>
								<p>We fixed some bugs related to these devices. We hope Hoccer will work properly on them with the newest version.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">How does Hoccer transport the files from phone to phone?</p>
								<p>Well, first of all, it does not use Bluetooth. Hoccer needs an internet connection. 
								   If you throw a file it is tagged with your current location and send to a server. 
								   When someone performs the catch gesture within a few seconds Hoccer contacts
                           the server and asks for pending files at the receivers location. If both locations 
                           are in range the file is sent to the receiver.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">How does Hoccer locate my position?</p>
								<p>First Hoccer checks the wireless access points in range. If both peers are in 
								   range of the same access point you don't need a GPS signal to hocc files. 
								   If no common access point is found Hoccer tries to get a GPS 
                           position. If GPS is not available the 'network location' is used as a fall back. 
                           Please keep in mind that Hoccer requires a decent lock on your location 
                           to function properly. Specially the fall back data might not be good enough. 
                           However, it will work as long as all peers agree on the same (wrong) location.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">How can I hocc between my phone and my computer?</p>
								<p>We implemented a <a href="hoc.html">Hoccer webclient</a>. Point the map to your current location and use the widget on 
								   the right-hand side to hocc files.</p> <br>
								
								<p id="question">How can I hocc my files without using a gestures?</p>
								<p>Not on the phone. But you can use our <a href="hoc.html">webclinent</a> to hocc files without a gesture.
