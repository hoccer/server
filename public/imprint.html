							ART+COM Technologies GmbH takes the protection of personal data very seriously.
							We would like to inform you when we are storing the data you give us, which data
							we are storing and how we are using that data. In our capacity as a private
							company we are subject to the German Federal Data Protection Law (BDSG).<br>
	
							<strong>Personal Data</strong><br>
							Personal data is information that can be used to establish your identity. This
							includes information such as your name, your address, your postal address and
							your telephone number. Information that cannot be linked to your true identity
							(e.g. favourite websites or the number of visitors on a particular website) is
							not considered personal data.
	
							You can consult our website without revealing your identity. We only ask you for
							your name and other personal information when you register for our newsletter.
							It is your decision whether you choose to supply us with this information.
	
							In order for Hoccer to work, data is sent to and transmitted via our Hoccer
							server. This data includes your mobile phone number, your current geographical
							location, the current time and the content. For statistical purposes, in order
							to provide our users with a high performance service, we will retain the
							location and time. All other data is deleted after content transfer is completed
							or after 15 seconds (for example if the transfer could not be completed).
	
							We save your data on maximum security German servers. Only a few individuals who
							are technically or commercially involved in the maintenance of the servers have
							access to this data. When you connect to our website certain items of
							information are recorded on our servers for security purposes. This data may
							make identification possible (e.g. IP address, date, time and pages consulted).
							No personal identification is carried out. We reserve the right to evaluate
							anonymous data for statistical purposes.
	
							<strong>The Passing of Personal Data to Third Parties</strong>
							Use of your personal information is restricted to the internal activities of
							ART+COM Technologies GmbH. We do not pass this data to third parties.<br>
	
							<strong>Right to retract your information</strong>
							If you have given us personal information you are free to erase this information
							at any time.<br>
	
							<strong>Links to other website</strong><br>
							Our website contains links to other websites. We have no influence on whether
							the operators of these websites observe the laws on data protection.<br>
